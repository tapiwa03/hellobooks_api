## How to navigate through the application endpoints
- The app makes use of JWT tokens for authentication and can take JSON requests at will.
- Postman is used to input data and get output data from the system
- PyTest is used to test the endpoints of the APIs
- First register a user with a name, email and password. After that login. Then it is possible to change password, and borrow a book under a normal user
- For the book functions you need to enter the book data in the following JSON format otherwise it will raise an error:
```
{
    'book_id':'1',
    'title':'War and Peace',
    'author': 'Leo Tolstoy',
    'date_published': '02/12/2008',
    'genre':'fiction',
    'description':'This is a description about the book war and peace by leo tolstoy'
}
```
- User data is also entered in json format and should take the same format as above
